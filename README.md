# DeepBeliefNetwork
C++ implementation of the Deep Belief Network for classifying MNIST digits discussed in G. Hinton paper "A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets".
## State of the project
Until now I have implemented the associative memory layer in Python and the data handiling and the associative memory in C++.
## To do
- hidden layer implementation
- try to parallelize with CUDA for gpu acceleration
- fine tuning with wake-sleep algorithm
